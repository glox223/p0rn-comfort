=head1 NAME

p0rn-download - download URLs queued in p0rn database

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<p0rn-download>

=head1 OVERVIEW

p0rn-download starts to download the URLs queued in the p0rn database.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

p0rn-download starts a massive parallel download via L<p0rn-grab(1)>.
Downloaded files appear in B<./out>.

=head1 FILES

All data is stored in a database.  By default, it is located in
B<./p0rn.db> (yes, that's the directory from which you're starting
p0rn-download).  If you want to change this, set the environment
variable B<P0RNDBLOCATION> (the second letter is a zero) to another
path and filename.
