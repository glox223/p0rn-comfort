This is a suite for more comfortable p0rn browsing :-)

Get new versions from: http://www.cgarbs.de/p0rn-comfort.en.html

You need:
- lynx
- wget
- bash
- perl with working fork()
- perl modules:
  - AppConfig
  - BerkeleyDB
  - HTTP::Daemon
  - HTTP::Response
  - HTTP::Status
  - LWP::UserAgent

You do this:

Start the proxy and point your browser to it.  Notice the extra
functionality at the top of every page.

Then find a p0rn-thumbnail site and start browsing it.  When you run
across other thumbnail sites instead of content, select "mark as
thumbnail page".  In the future, this page will not be loaded again.
Should you by any means run into content, then you can select "mark as
pictures" or "mark as pictures and download".  This will tell you
when you visit a content site again that you've always seen (we don't
really memorize all of our downloaded stuff, do we?).

Run p0rn-download to start downloading all the pictures that you have
selected for download.
